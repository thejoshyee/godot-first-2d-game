# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a "Dodge the Creeps" 2D game built with Godot 4.5. The player controls a character that moves around the screen avoiding enemies. This appears to be following the official Godot tutorial for creating your first 2D game.

## Project Configuration

- **Engine Version**: Godot 4.5
- **Renderer**: Forward Plus
- **Viewport Size**: 480x720 (portrait orientation)
- **Stretch Mode**: canvas_items

## Input Actions

Custom input actions are defined in `project.godot`:
- `move_right`: Right arrow key
- `move_left`: Left arrow key
- `move_up`: Up arrow key
- `move_down`: Down arrow key

All actions use a deadzone of 0.2.

## Scene and Script Architecture

### Player Scene (`player.tscn`)
The player is an `Area2D` node with:
- `AnimatedSprite2D` child: Handles animations ("walk" and "up")
- `CollisionShape2D` child: CapsuleShape2D for collision detection
- Connected signal: `body_entered` triggers `_on_body_entered()`

### Player Script (`player.gd`)
Key elements:
- **Signal**: `hit` - emitted when player collides with an enemy
- **Export variable**: `speed` (400 pixels/sec) - adjustable in the editor
- **Movement**: Arrow key input controls velocity, normalized for diagonal movement
- **Animation logic**: Switches between "walk" (horizontal) and "up" (vertical) animations with sprite flipping
- **Collision handling**: `_on_body_entered()` hides player, emits hit signal, and disables collision shape
- **start() method**: Bug on line 58 - `post` should be `pos` parameter

## Working with GDScript Files

When editing `.gd` files:
- Use static typing (`: Type`) for function parameters and return values
- Use `@export` for inspector-editable variables
- Node references use `$NodeName` syntax
- Signal connections are defined in `.tscn` files
- Use `set_deferred()` when changing physics properties during physics callbacks

## Working with Scene Files

`.tscn` files are Godot scene files in text format:
- These define the node hierarchy and properties
- Resource references use `uid://` paths
- Scene editing is typically done in the Godot editor, not manually
- When referencing scripts, use `path="res://script_name.gd"`

## Asset Organization

- `art/`: Contains sprite images (player, enemies) and audio files (.ogg)
- `fonts/`: Contains the Xolonium font family
- All assets have corresponding `.import` files generated by Godot

## Running the Project

This project must be opened and run through the Godot editor. There are no build commands or test frameworks - testing is done by running the game in the Godot editor (F5 or the play button).
